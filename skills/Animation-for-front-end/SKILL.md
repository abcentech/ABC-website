# Animation for front end

## Principles
- **Subtlety**: Motion should be slower than reading speed. It should be felt rather than explicitly noticed.
- **Depth**: Use multiple layers of motion to create a sense of three-dimensional space.
- **Consistency**: Colors and timing should remain harmonious with the overall brand aesthetic.

## Recommended Techniques
- **Soft Animated Gradients**: Use oversized blurred blobs with very slow translation/rotation.
- **Light Field / Beam Texture**: Slanted gradients or lines that pulse or move slowly across the background.
- **Particle Drift**: Small, low-opacity circles or SVGs that float or drift with slight variations in speed.
- **Grid Shimmer**: A subtle background grid with "active" cells that light up or shimmer periodically.
- **Slow Parallax Abstract Shapes**: Large, low-contrast SVG shapes that move slightly differently from the scroll speed.

## Goal
- Make the page feel "alive".
- Add professional depth.
- Signal high-level polish at a glance.
